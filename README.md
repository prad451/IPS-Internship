## Task 1 : Fake News Detection Project
This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news.Using sklearn, I build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset.Then,initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell how well our model fares.
## Task 2 : Housing Prices Prediction Project
This is Housing Price Prediction Project using linear regression.This projects aim is to make a model which can give us a good house pricing prediction based on other variables.
I have used Linear Regression for this dataset and hence it gave a good accuracy.
